# Machine learning projects or Kaggle Competitions
This repository is for Machine learning projects or Kaggle competitions.
* Digit Recoganizer (Kaggle)
* Titantic (Kaggel)
* SVD (image compression experiment)
* Neural Network/Back Propagation Java implementation
* Random Forest implementation and human written digits recoganization 
* (t-SNE) is a technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. 
* Implementation of EM (expectation maximization) algorithm for A two-coin-flipping experiment (http://ai.stanford.edu/~chuongdo/papers/em_tutorial.pdf)
* PLSA java implementation to find topics and concepts from weibo. It is based on EM algorithm. A reference is http://blog.jqian.net/post/plsa.html 

This tries to find topics/concepts from a list of weibos.
