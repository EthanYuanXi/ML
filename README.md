# Machine learning projects or Kaggle Competitions
This repository is for Machine learning projects or Kaggle competitions.
* Digit Recoganizer (Kaggle)
* Titantic (Kaggel)
* SVD (image compression experiment)
* Neural Network/Back Propagation Java implementation
* Random Forest implementation and human written digits recoganization 
* (t-SNE) is a technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets.
